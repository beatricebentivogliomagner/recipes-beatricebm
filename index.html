    <h3>Fried Mozzarella</h3>
</article>

<img src="images/mozzarella-optimized.jpg" alt="fried mozzarella cheese" width="100%">

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
    <li>White bread loaf 12 slices</li>
    <li>Fine salt to taste</li>
    <li>Flour 00 1 cup</li>
    <li>Mozzarella di bufala cheese 500 g - preferably the day before</li>
    <li>Eggs 5</li>
    <li>Breadcrumbs 300 g</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>

<ol>
    <li>To prepare the fried mozzarella, start by cutting the buffalo mozzarella into thick slices (1cm). Place them gradually on a tray lined with blotting paper and cover with more blotting paper. 
    </li>
    <li>Press gently with your hands to blot the mozzarella and remove excess water. If necessary, use paper towels until it is completely dry. At this point, go ahead and stuff the bread.
    </li>
    <li> Put the slices of bread on a cutting board. Place the slices of mozzarella on top, so as to cover the entire surface, but without letting it stick out, salt and cover each slice with another slice of bread .
    </li>
    <li>Press gently with your hands to pack it all together. Continue like this for all the other slices of bread, until you finish the mozzarella. Then trim the slices of stuffed bread using a knife, to remove the outer crust. At this point you can cut the mozzarella in the bread in two different ways. By cutting a cross you will get 4 squares from each slice.
    </li>
    <li>For a triangular cut you have to cut the bread first in half on the diagonal and then in half on the other diagonal. This way you will get 4 triangles. Continue this way until all the pieces are finished. Now switch to the breading. Break the eggs into an oven dish and beat them with a whisk for a few minutes.
    </li>
    <li>On two other baking dishes place the breadcrumbs in one and the sifted flour in the other. At this point dip each piece of stuffed bread first into the flour and then using 2 forks into the egg, to coat them completely. Then set them on a plate for a few seconds to remove the excess egg part nd avoid lumps when you dip it in the breadcrumbs.
    </li>
    <li>Transfer to a cutting board and with the blade of a knife lightly press the edges and the surface in order to even out the breadcrumbs and make a more precise shape. If necessary, dip it in the breadcrumbs again and press again with the knife blade. Continue in this way for all the other pieces and transfer them gradually to a tray lined with baking paper. Then place in the fridge for about 30 minutes. 
    </li>
    <li>After the breaded mozzarella has set, you can start with the second breading, first dip into the egg, then set in the saucer to remove the excess and finally dip in the breadcrumbs. As previously, then transfer the pieces of breaded mozzarella onto a cutting board and with the blade of a knife even out the breadcrumbs. Continue this way for all the others by placing them on a tray lined with baking paper. Store in the fridge to set for another 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Pour the oil into a frying pan and bring it to a temperature of 170-180°C maximum. Put in a few pieces at a time and cook the fried mozzarellas for 1-2 minutes, turning them from time to time with a skimmer. When they are well browned, drain them from the oil and put them on a tray lined with absorbent paper to remove the excess oil. Fry the others and serve. 
    </li>

 </ol>   
 <h4>Tips</h4> 
    <p>To prepare fried mozzarella i recommend using mozzarella opened the day before, so it will be drier. This way it will not spill out during cooking.

</article>

<img src="images/pizzas-optimized.jpg" alt="some miniature pizzas with mozzarella cheese" width="100%">

<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Water 1 cup - at room temperature</li>
    <li>Fresh brewer's yeast 1 tsp</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil ⅓ cup</li>
    <li>Flour 00 4 cups </li>
    <li>Sugar 3 tsp</li>
    <li>Fine salt 1 tsp</li>
    <li>Tomato puree 1 ⅓ cup</li>
    <li>Mozzarella cheese 250g</li>
    <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Oregano to taste</li>
    
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>

<ol>
    <li>To prepare miniature pizzas, first place the flour in a bowl together with the crumbled fresh brewer's yeast. Add water at room temperature and stir with a wooden spoon. 
    </li>
    <li>Add sugar, salt and pour in oil.
    </li>
    <li> Mix the ingredients thoroughly, then transfer to a work surface and knead vigorously until smooth.
    </li>
    <li>Form a ball with the kneaded dough, oil a large bowl and place the dough in it, cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for about 3 hours at room temperature, away from drafts or in an oven with the light on. Once the dough has risen, it will have tripled in volume.
    </li>
    <li>In the meantime, prepare the pizza topping: in a bowl pour the tomato, season with salt, pepper, oregano and oil. Mix everything with a spoon and set aside until you need to use it.
    </li>
    <li>Transfer the leavened dough onto a pastry board and sprinkle with very little flour; roll out with a rolling pin until you obtain a rectangle about 4 mm thick.
    </li>
    <li>Oil thoroughly the drip pan where you will cook miniature pizzas. Cut the dough with a 7.5 cm diameter round pastry cutter. Take the excess dough, give it a round shape and let it rest covered for about 10 minutes. You can knead any excess dough and make more pizzas: you will get a total of 24 miniature pizzas! Take them one by one with a spatula and start placing them on the baking tray.
    </li>
    <li>Once the miniature pizzas are on the tray, apply some pressure in the center, leaving a 0.5 cm edge. Cut mozzarella cheese into cubes and season the center with tomato and mozzarella cubes, drizzle with oil and a pinch of oregano to taste. Bake the miniature pizzas in a static oven preheated to 200°C: the first 10 minutes with the tray on the lower shelf; the remaining 5 minutes on the top shelf. Once cooked, take out the red miniature pizzas and serve them hot!

    <h3>Spaghetti with clams</h3>
</article>



<img src="images/spaghettivongole-optimized.jpg" alt="spaghetti with clams" width="100%">


<h4>Ingredients</h4>


<ul>
    <li>Spaghetti 350g</li>
    <li>Garlic 1 clove</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil to taste</li>
    <li>Fine salt to taste</li>
    <li>Clams 1 kg</li>
    <li>Parsley 1 small bunch</li>
    <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Coarse salt to taste - for the clams</li>
    
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>

<ol>
    <li>To make spaghetti with clams, start by cleaning the clams. Make sure there are no broken or empty shells which have to be discarded. Then beat them against the sink or on a cutting board. This step is important to check that there is no sand inside: healthy clams will remain closed, while those full of sand will open. Then place them in a colander over a bowl and rinse them. Place the colander in a bowl and add plenty of coarse salt. Let the clams soak for 2-3 hours.
    </li>
    <li>Once the time has passed, the clams will have purged any residual sand. Heat some oil in a pan. Then add a clove of garlic and, as the oil takes on flavor, drain the clams well, rinse them, and plunge them in the hot pan. Cover with a lid and let them cook for a few minutes over high heat.
    </li>
    <li> The clams will open with heat, so shake the pan from time to time until they are completely open. As soon as they are all open, turn off the heat immediately, otherwise the clams will cook too much. Collect the juice by draining the clams, and do not forget to discard the garlic. In the meantime, cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water and drain halfway through the total cooking time of the spaghetti.
    </li>
    <li>Then pour the sauce into a pan, add the spaghetti, and continue cooking using some cooking water. Your pasta will finish cooking in the pan. When cooked, add the clams and chopped parsley. Heat everything on high for a few seconds and the spaghetti with clams is ready: serve immediately!

</article>



<img src="images/tagliata-optimized.jpg" alt="beef tagliata on a wooden plate" width="100%">


<h4>Ingredients</h4>


<ul>
    <li>Entrecôte 800 g</li>
    <li>Cherry tomatoes 100 g</li>
    <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Arugula 100 g</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil to taste</li>
</ul>

<h4>Preparation</h4>

<ol>
    <li>To prepare sliced beef tagliata with arugula and cherry tomatoes, make sure to take the piece of entrecôte out of the fridge at least one hour before cooking, as the meat must not be cooked cold.

Then cut crosswise to obtain several slices with a sharp non-serrated knife. Arrange a bed of arugula on a serving plate, the beef tagliata, and some tomatoes. A drizzle of oil, flakes of salt (or coarse salt) and freshly ground pepper. and your sliced beef tagliata with arugula and cherry tomatoes is ready to be served!

<ol>
    <li>To make foil-baked sea bream, if your sea bream requires cleaning, proceed as follows: cut the belly with scissors and proceed straight up to below the head, then pull out the innards. Wash the belly of the fish well under running water to remove all traces of blood. Using the same scissors, cut first the side fin near the head, the tail fin under the belly and finally the fin on the back of the fish. Turn the fish to the other side and remove the other fin and tail fin. Using a descaling tool, or the blade of a knife, carefully scale the sea bream, from the tail towards the head. Rinse the sea bream under running water again, washing it carefully also on the outside.
    </li>
    <li>Wash and mince the parsley. Place a sheet of baking paper on a baking tray and place each clean sea bream in the middle, seasoning the inside with salt 5 and pepper.
    </li>
    <li> Proceed to stuffing the belly with the herbs: sprigs of thyme previously washed and dried, half a clove of peeled garlic for each sea bream, half a slice of lemon and extra virgin olive oil.
    </li>
    <li>Drizzle the sea bream with a little olive oil then close the baking paper sheet by rolling up the two ends. Wrap it in aluminum foil and twist the ends to seal.
    </li>
    <li> Place the sea bream on a baking tray and bake in a static oven preheated to 180°C for about 40 minutes. When cooked, take the sea bream out of the oven, let it cool, then serve it in the foil itself, sprinkling it with fresh parsley if you like.
